Building a brand on Amazon is not an easy task❌. It demands time⏳, patience🧠, hard work📈 and trust🤝.

Amazon represents a modern form of business for selling and buy products🚀. It is a motivational and challenging period to launch a new product📈. Myself Azan and I would be delighted if I had the opportunity to manage your brand as a virtual assistant😊, which would add some more value to my 2 years of experience in the e-commerce industry🎓.

PPC Management is the key to success in Private Label📢. In order to make a product launch successful🚀, PPC campaigns play an important role in increasing visibility and scalability🚀. Sponsored Product Ads, Sponsored Brand Ads and Sponsored Display Ads have all been a part of my personal experience, including Exact Match Targeting and Broad Match Targeting as well as ASIN Targeting📢.

The following is our launch plan📝 for any new product:
✅ Product Approval (Hunting & Research)
✅ Social Listening & Product Differentiation
✅ Package Selection
✅ Sourcing & Manufacturing & Shipment of inventory
✅ Listing Creation and Listing Optimization
✅ Product Photography & Video shooting
✅ Sales Copy
✅ PPC Structure
✅ Giveaways Plan

Client satisfaction and personal learning is my ultimate goal🎯 .
